# k8s-pilot

**The Central Pilot for Your Kubernetes Fleets ✈️✈️**

`k8s_pilot` is a lightweight, centralized control plane server for managing **multiple Kubernetes clusters** at once.  
With powerful tools and intuitive APIs, you can observe and control all your clusters from one cockpit.

---

## 🚀 Overview

- 🔄 Supports **multi-cluster context switching**
- 🔧 Enables **CRUD operations** on most common Kubernetes resources
- ⚙️ Powered by [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for Claude AI and beyond

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Python **3.13** or higher
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Access to Kubernetes clusters (`~/.kube/config` or in-cluster config)

```bash
# Install uv (if not installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bourbonkk/k8s-pilot.git
cd k8s-pilot

# Launch with uv + MCP
uv run --with mcp[cli] mcp run k8s_pilot.py
```

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Use this config to run k8s_pilot MCP server from within Claude:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "k8s_pilot": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<path-to-cloned-repo>/k8s-pilot",
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "k8s_pilot.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace <path-to-cloned-repo> with the actual directory where you cloned the repo.
